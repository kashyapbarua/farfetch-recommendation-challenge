# Farfetch Recommendation Challenge
 
The importance of online sales in the luxury fashion space has been growing at an accelerated pace in the last few years, as consumers of this once traditional industry now expect easy access to a worldwide network of brands and retailers. FARFETCH operates in this space and has the mission to bring together creators, curators, and consumers of fashion, all over the world.

In this challenge, you will attempt to solve this problem by building your own recommendations algorithms while working with a real-world dataset.
